# Lab 5 Overview
During Lab 4, students worked with an inertial measurement  unit (IMU) to calculate angular position. The gyroscope and accelerometer on the IMU were utilized. Then, students queried data from both the IMU and the ToF sensor from lab 3. The sensors as wired for the majority of the lab are pictured below.
