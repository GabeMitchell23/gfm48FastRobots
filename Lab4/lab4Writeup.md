# Lab 4 Overview
During Lab 4, students worked with an inertial measurment unit (IMU) to calculate angular position. The gyroscope and accelerometer on the IMU were utilized. Then, students queried data from both the IMU and the ToF sensor from lab 3. The sensors as wired for the majority of the lab are pictured below.

At the end of the lab, the electronics were removed from my laptop and plugged into a separate battery. The artemis, battery, and sensors were then fastened onto the RC car, where they querieid and transferred data as the car performed a stunt. The electronics on the car are pictured below.
